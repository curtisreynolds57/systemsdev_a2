Made in part by Nicholas Drapak, Jonithan James, and Curtis Reynolds.

**Project Information**
-
This project involves everything we have learned so far in 2020u.
It includes graphics, server sockets and connections, and the best-looking coding practices taught.
The client will connect and will be able to play a tic-tac-toe game with another connected client.

**Possible Improvements**
-
What did not have enough time to get this one hundred percent running for everyone. If it doesn't run for you,
we have the video attached with the deliverables that shows it running. We could have also improved our usage
of GitHub, as we mostly shared through Direct Messages.
